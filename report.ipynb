    "An example URL that we can scrape data from is [`https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search?combine=&state=All&year=&case_type=All&fraud_type=All&page=0`](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search?combine=&state=All&year=&case_type=All&fraud_type=All&page=0). Their entire database should have be been queried, and it shows 15 results per page over 63 pages. This makes our lives a little difficult. By this reckoning, there should be 62 * 15 + 7 = 937 records. \n",

    "This is a little worrying, as in big bold letters on The Heritage Foundation [Voter Fraud report splash page](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud), they claim they have collected \"1,277 proven instances of voter fraud\". This is different than their [printable report](https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/voterfraud_download/VoterFraudCases_5.pdf), which lists \"1,088 proven instances\", and different yet again from the [White House document](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/docs/pacei-voterfraudcases.pdf) saved as part of the now-defunct PACEI effort (decudible from the URL), which lists 1,071. Since the commission ended in 2018, it stands to reason that The Heritage Foundation might have added to their online database...it remains to be seen if that data is public-facing. \n",
    "\n",
    "PACEI was the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which was disbanded after a lawsuit from commision member Secetary of State Matthew Dunlap of the State of Maine that alleged that he and other members were illegally excluded from its work. The generally-held consensus is that the commission found no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and the PACEI was formed for the sole purpose of backing up President's Trump unproven claims of the same. An overview of the situation can be found on [Maine's government website](https://www.maine.gov/sos/news/2018/paceidocs.html) and on a [left-leaning administration watchdog](https://www.americanoversight.org/investigation/dunlap-v-pacei-investigating-voter-fraud-commission). \n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the Heritage Foundation was considered a worthy source of data for a presidental commission, it's worth getting a handle on what is actually in their database. Unfortunately, they have not made the database easily available, and we have to resort to scraping individual webpages. "
