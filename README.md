An investigation into The Heritage Foundation's Report on Voter Fraud

The White House and the Trump Administration has repeatedly made claims about widespread voter fraud with regards to mail-in ballots and bad actors. These claims have also been connected with calls for stronger Voter ID laws. Other more recent pushes include recruiting poll monitors to ensure election integrity.

The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, published a database containing instances of "confirmed voter fraud". They claim it is not an exhaustive list, but have used it in [justifications for the proof of bipartisan voter fraud](https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/more-proof-voter-fraud-real-and-bipartisan).

Given that The White House has adopted the printed report on its website, it seems worthy of investigation and visualization to see its contents more clearly.

This repository will scrape the dataset used to produce these reports, and investigate the findings year-over-year in a Jupyter Notebook.
