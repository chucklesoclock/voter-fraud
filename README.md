The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think-tank, published a database containing instances of "confirm voter fraud". They claim it is not an exhaustive list, but have used it in [justifications for the proof of bipartisan voter fraud](https://www.heritage.org/election-integrity/commentary/more-proof-voter-fraud-real-and-bipartisan).

This repository will scrape the dataset used to produce these reports, and investigate the findings year-over-year in a Jupyter Notebook.
